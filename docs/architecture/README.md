# Architecture, phase by phase

Each diagram shows the whole DevOps and GitOps architecture of this system as implemented after one phase of the demo-environment skill. Elements with a green border were added in that phase; dashed elements are names already trusted (a federated subject, an OIDC identity) but not created yet.

The `.puml` files are the sources (C4-PlantUML); the `.png` files are rendered from them by `write-architecture-diagrams.ps1` in the demo-environment kit.
