.SYNOPSIS
    Writes delivery.json: the delivery facts of this system, per environment and deployable, read from Octopus and
    GitHub. It changes nothing in either.

.DESCRIPTION
    The workflow "delivery" runs it and publishes the file as the only file of branch "status", where the health
    dashboard reads it from the browser (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repository>/status/delivery.json).

    Per environment of system.json and per deployable (the Octopus project <slug>-<deployable>, and <slug>-system as
    deployable "system"):
      version, deployedAt, releaseUrl   the release of the last successful deployment and when it finished
      signedOffBy, reason               who answered that deployment's "Sign-off" with Proceed, and the note they gave
                                        (null in the first environment, which has no sign-off)
      lastPersonSignOff                 the newest successful deployment there whose "Sign-off" a person answered with
                                        Proceed: version, by, at (when they answered), reason and releaseUrl. A person
                                        is an Octopus user that is not a service account; automation signs off as
                                        one. null when no person did among the project's newest hundred answers to
                                        interruptions, and in the first environment
      commit, commitAt, leadTimeHours   the commit the release was built from (the 40-character SHA in its release
                                        notes, as the release workflows write them; else its build information), when
                                        it was committed (GitHub), and deployedAt minus commitAt
      behindFirst                       versions: how many releases newer than this one the first environment runs;
                                        days: how long ago both ran the same release (0 and 0 when they do now)
      deploymentsLast7Days, failedLast7Days
                                        deployments that finished in the last seven days (Success, Failed, TimedOut;
                                        a cancelled one counts as neither), and those of them that failed
    Per environment, health: what the hourly runbook "Health report" found (it asks every node of the environment and
    its public address, and fails when one is not healthy):
      last24Hours, last7Days            reports: its runs there that finished in that time (Success, Failed, TimedOut;
                                        a cancelled one counts as neither); healthy: those of them that succeeded
      lastFailure                       when the last run that did not succeed finished; null when none did in seven
                                        days
    These are hourly checks by the pipeline, not continuous monitoring: an outage between two runs is not counted.
    One call per environment (the runbook's own runs there, finished in the last seven days); null when the system has
    no such runbook or the runs cannot be read.
    failover: the last successful run of runbook "Failover test" whose log reports a measurement: the environment,
    when it finished, and the seconds until the public address answered from the standby.

    Times are UTC. A fact that cannot be determined is null, with a SKIP line that says why; only Octopus not
    answering (or refusing the credential) fails the run, so a published file is never replaced by an empty one.

    Octopus: OCTOPUS_API_KEY when set (the operator), otherwise OCTOPUS_ACCESS_TOKEN (OctopusDeploy/login), as
    test-capabilities.ps1. GitHub: gh with GH_TOKEN or its own login; the repositories are public.
